# scott-moe-bot

A Discord bot that posts a gif of Scott Moe doing a silly moose dance, any time 'scott' and 'moe' appear in a message.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)
- [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
- [A Discord bot token](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)

### Installation

1. Clone:

```
git clone https://github.com/bradendubois/scott-moe-bot
```

2. Get your token [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)

3. Write that token to a `.env` file in the same directory as the `scott.py` file:

```
cd src
echo MY_SUPER_SECRET_TOKEN > .env
```

4. Add the bot to your server using an OAuth link, it only needs permission to send messages.

5. Run the bot:

```
python scott.py
```

6. Say 'Scott' and 'Moe' (case insensitive, in either order) in any message.

7.

## Why?

In hindsight, I'm not sure anymore.

I consider this a low point both for myself, and comedy as a whole.
